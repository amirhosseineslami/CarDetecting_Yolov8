# Drone-Based Object Detection and Tracking

## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing and analyzing drone-based object detection and tracking using the Visdrone dataset. The primary goal is to train a model capable of detecting various objects from aerial images and videos, leveraging the Ultralytics framework.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drone-object-detection.git
cd drone-object-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The project uses the Visdrone dataset, a large-scale benchmark created by the AISKYEYE team at Tianjin University, China. The dataset includes:

- 288 video clips with 261,908 frames
- 10,209 still images
- Annotations for objects like pedestrians, vehicles, bicycles, etc.

You can download the dataset from [this link](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/VisDrone.yaml).

## Training the Model

We utilize Google Colab for training due to its computational resources. To train the model, follow these steps:

1. Open a new notebook in Google Colab.
2. Install the Ultralytics package using the following code:
   
   ```python
   !pip install ultralytics
   ```

3. Set up the Visdrone dataset in your Colab environment.
4. Train the model using the provided configuration file and training script.

## Visualization

We use TensorBoard to visualize the training process. After training, you can visualize the results using the following command:

```python
%load_ext tensorboard
%tensorboard --logdir=runs
```

## Prediction

Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on aerial videos. Use the following code snippet to run predictions:

```python
# Prediction code here
```

## Results

The trained model effectively detects and tracks objects from aerial footage. Here are some examples of the model's performance:
